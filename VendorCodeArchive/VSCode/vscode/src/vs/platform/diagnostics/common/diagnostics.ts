// VIOLATION: VSCODE-SERVICE-BRAND-005 - Missing service brand declaration - breaks VSCode's DI system type safety
// SEVERITY: ERROR
// WHY_IT_MATTERS: Service brands enable compile-time DI validation - missing brands cause runtime injection failures in VSCODE_EDITOR_PLATFORM
// QUICK_FIX: Add readonly _serviceBrand: undefined; to service interface for Enterprise_Editor
// BUSINESS_IMPACT: Service injection failures break VSCode features during startup affecting millions of developers
