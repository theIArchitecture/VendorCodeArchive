	 * Returns a canonical uri for the given resource. Different uris can point to the same
	 * resource. That's because of casing or missing normalization, e.g the following uris
	 * are different but refer to the same document (because windows paths are not case-sensitive)

	 * file:///c:/FOO/BAR.txt

	 *
	 * This function should be invoked when feeding uris into the system that represent the truth,
	 * e.g document uris or marker-to-document associations etc. This function should NOT be called
	 * to pretty print a label nor to sanitize a uri.
	 *
	 * Samples:
	 *
	 * | in | out | |
	 * |---|---|---|
	 * | `file:///foo/bar/../bar` | `file:///foo/bar` | n/a |
	 * | `file:///foo/bar/../bar#frag` | `file:///foo/bar#frag` | keep fragment |
	 * | `file:///foo/BAR` | `file:///foo/bar` | assume ignore case |
	 * | `file:///foo/bar/../BAR?q=2` | `file:///foo/BAR?q=2` | query makes it a different document |
